## :file_folder: AirBnB_clone_version2 & The Console

This repository/project contains the initial stage of building a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. The Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

## :scroll: How to use (The Console):
-  First clone this repository
-  After cloning locate the `console.py` file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
- When this command is executed the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
## :envelope: The Commands
```
create - Creates an instance based on given class

destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)
```

## :incoming_envelope: The Alternative Syntax
Users can also issue a number of console commands using an alternative syntax:
The commands are:
```
all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

count - Return number of object instances by class

show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID
```
